#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The entrypoint of every Open AD Kit image.
#
# Started as root, it gives the aw user the host user's ids (HOST_UID and
# HOST_GID, which the CLI sets), so what the services write to mounted host
# directories belongs to that user, and runs itself again as aw. As aw it
# layers the kit over Autoware, then runs the container command.
# /tmp/openadkit is rebuilt on every start, so an override that was removed
# never lingers:
#   1. ROS, Autoware and the kit's overlay workspace, if mounted, are sourced;
#   2. overlay.py copies autoware_launch and every package with overrides into
#      /tmp/openadkit, merges the YAML overrides parameter by parameter and
#      links the selected vehicle description;
#   3. those copies go first on AMENT_PREFIX_PATH, so $(find-pkg-share) finds
#      the merged files. Launch arguments in our Compose files point at the
#      same stable paths.
