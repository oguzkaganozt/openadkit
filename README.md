**The deployment layer for the Autoware ecosystem.**

[Autoware](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware) provides the autonomy stack; Open AD Kit makes it deployable. It packages the stack into focused container images and ready-to-run deployments, with [Autoware Safety Island](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-safety-island/) alongside. One CLI runs them the same way on every host.

One reproducible path from simulation to in-vehicle systems.">

## Quickstart

From nothing to a driving Autoware on Ubuntu. No GPU needed. The [full Quickstart](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/openadkit/getting-started/) has the details.

> [!NOTE]
> **v2.0.0 is not published yet.** Until it is, [build the images from a source checkout](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/openadkit/development/build-from-source/) and run the commands below as `./openadkit` from its root, without the `install` step.

```bash
# 1. Install the CLI
curl -fsSL https://github.com/autowarefoundation/openadkit/releases/latest/download/openadkit \
  | bash -s -- install

# 2. Prepare the host
openadkit setup --check

# 3. Start Autoware
openadkit run planning-simulation

# 4. Drive: open http://localhost:6080/vnc.html (password: openadkit), set an
#    initial pose and a goal. The vehicle plans the route and drives it.

# 5. Stop
openadkit stop
```

## Deployments

A deployment is a ready-to-run Autoware stack for one task. `openadkit list` prints them in your terminal.

| Deployment | What it runs | Requires |
|---|---|---|
| [`planning-simulation`](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/openadkit/deployments/planning-simulation/) | Plan and follow a route on a sample map<br>`--gpu` plans with the Diffusion Planner (experimental) | |
| [`scenario-simulation`](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/openadkit/deployments/scenario-simulation/) | Predefined traffic scenarios in Scenario Simulator<br>`--role` [splits it across two hosts](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/openadkit/deployments/split-host/) (experimental) | |
| [`logging-simulation`](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/openadkit/deployments/logging-simulation/) | Replay recorded sensor data, sensing to localization<br>`--gpu` runs CenterPoint on CUDA | |
| [`carla-simulation`](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/openadkit/deployments/carla-simulation/) | Closed-loop driving in the CARLA simulator<br>`--role` [splits it across two hosts](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/openadkit/deployments/split-host/) (experimental) | NVIDIA GPU<br>amd64, Humble |
| [`safety-island-simulation`](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/openadkit/deployments/safety-island-simulation/) | Planning Simulation controlled by the Safety Island | amd64 |

## Create a Kit

A kit holds only your differences from a deployment: your ROS packages, parameter overrides and extra services. [Create a Kit](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/openadkit/kits/create-a-kit/) covers the layout and each extension point.

```bash
openadkit new my-kit        # on top of planning-simulation
cd my-kit
openadkit build             # your overlay workspace
openadkit run --verify      # start, wait until ready, run the verify step
```
