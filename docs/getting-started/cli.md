# CLI & Maintenance

Commands you need after the first run: runtime controls, validation,
configuration, upgrades, and cleanup.

--8<-- "includes/cli-command-context.md"

## Runtime Controls

```bash
openadkit status planning-simulation
openadkit logs planning-simulation --follow
openadkit stop planning-simulation
```

Pass the deployment name. Without it, these commands only list what is running.
One deployment runs at a time; `run` asks you to stop the current one first.
After starting, `run` watches the services for 10 seconds and fails if one
crashes.
`openadkit run <deployment> --pull always` refreshes images before starting,
and `openadkit --version` prints the installed version.

## Validate Before Running

```bash
openadkit validate planning-simulation --data
```

`validate` checks the manifest and the Compose configuration without starting
anything. `--data` also reports each data resource as `ok`, `missing`, or
`incomplete` and fails on any gap. It follows the same GPU selection as `run`:
use `openadkit validate logging-simulation --gpu --data` to include the
CenterPoint models.

`list`, `version`, and `validate` accept `--json` for scripting.

## Configuration

Each deployment reads its settings from environment files, in this order
(later files win):

1. `deployments/<name>/config.env`: the deployment defaults
2. `deployments/<name>/config.gpu.env`: GPU settings, loaded only with `--gpu`
3. `~/.config/openadkit/<name>.env`: your host settings

Shell exports do not override variables defined in these files. Put host
settings such as `MAP_PATH` or `REMOTE_PASSWORD` in your host settings file.
It lives outside the release, so upgrades keep it. Source checkouts can also
override component images there; release images stay pinned.

| Directory | Default | Override |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host settings | `~/.config/openadkit` | `OPENADKIT_CONFIG_DIR` (or `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) |
| Run results | `~/.local/state/openadkit/<name>/output` | `OPENADKIT_STATE_DIR` (or `XDG_STATE_HOME`) |

`deployments/<name>/config.local.env` is no longer read; the CLI warns when it
finds one. Move its settings to `~/.config/openadkit/<name>.env`.

## Upgrading

```bash
openadkit upgrade --check   # report whether a newer stable version exists
openadkit upgrade           # install it
```

The new release is verified and installed next to the old one, and the
`openadkit` launcher is repointed. The previous version stays in the install
destination (default `~/.local/share/openadkit/`), so you can roll back:

```bash
openadkit install --version vOLD --force
```

`--force` replaces the kept version directory; omit it to install a version
that is not kept. Source checkouts update with `git pull` instead.

## Uninstall and Cleanup

Stop running deployments first; `uninstall` refuses while any is running,
because it removes the launcher that `openadkit stop` needs.

```bash
openadkit stop planning-simulation
openadkit uninstall          # keep previously installed versions
openadkit uninstall --all    # remove kept versions too
```

`uninstall` is for release installs; remove a source checkout with Git. Host
settings in `~/.config/openadkit` and results in `~/.local/state/openadkit` are
kept.

Downloaded data (maps, rosbags, and perception models) lives under
`~/autoware_map` and `~/autoware_data` and is kept by `uninstall`. Inspect and
delete a deployment's data with:

```bash
openadkit clean planning-simulation            # report only
openadkit clean planning-simulation --data     # delete
```

`clean --data` refuses while that deployment is running. If Scenario
Simulation's Kashiwanoha map is removed, restore it with
`openadkit fetch scenario-simulation --force`.

`run` downloads missing data, but never replaces an existing data directory.
Replace incomplete or outdated managed data explicitly with `fetch --force`;
`run --force` is not supported.

The CLI marks the data it installs with a `.openadkit-resource.json` file.
`clean --data` and `--force` only delete or replace marked data. Data that was
already there, such as a map you copied yourself, is still used when it is
complete, but the CLI never deletes or replaces it; move or remove it yourself.

## Split-host nodes

`validate` and `run` accept `--node` for
[split-host simulation](../deployments/split-host.md). `status`, `logs`, and
`stop` find the live node from its Compose project; pass `--node` only when
several nodes of one deployment run on the same machine.

Each node's declared Compose entrypoint owns its full service graph, including
any bridge. The CLI selects those files and the node's ROS domain; it never
adds a networking service behind the scenes. The printed Compose command shows
the selected files, env files and project name.

## Verify a Release Bundle Manually

To inspect a release before running anything, download the bundle and check it
against the release metadata:

```bash
VERSION=$(curl -fsSL \
  https://api.github.com/repos/autowarefoundation/openadkit/releases/latest \
  | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["tag_name"])')
curl -fLO "https://github.com/autowarefoundation/openadkit/releases/download/${VERSION}/openadkit-${VERSION}.tar.gz"
curl -fLO "https://github.com/autowarefoundation/openadkit/releases/download/${VERSION}/release-metadata.json"
EXPECTED=$(python3 -c 'import json; print(json.load(open("release-metadata.json"))["bundles"][0]["sha256"])')
printf '%s  %s\n' "$EXPECTED" "openadkit-${VERSION}.tar.gz" | sha256sum --check -
tar -xzf "openadkit-${VERSION}.tar.gz"
cd "openadkit-${VERSION}"
```

The extracted directory is a complete runtime; run it with `./openadkit`.
