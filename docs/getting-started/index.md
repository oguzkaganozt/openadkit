# Getting Started

## Requirements

- Docker Engine
- Docker Compose
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit (Optional but highly recommended for sensing and perception tasks)
- Autoware artifacts (Optional but highly recommended for sensing and perception tasks)

    > All the above requirements can be installed by running the **setup.sh** script.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/autowarefoundation/openadkit
    cd openadkit
    ```

2. Setup the runtime environment by running the following command, requires sudo privileges ( Skip if you already have the environment setup on your platform ):

    ```bash
    sudo ./setup.sh
    ```

    > You can use the `--no-nvidia` flag to skip the installation of the NVIDIA Container Toolkit if you don't have a **NVIDIA GPU**. Otherwise, it's **highly recommended** to install it to utilize CUDA for better performance for sensing and perception tasks.

3. Download the Autoware artifacts by running the following command, requires sudo privileges:

    ```bash
    sudo ./setup.sh --download-artifacts
    ```
