# Split-host simulation (Zenoh)

Run the Autoware stack on one lab machine and the simulator on another.
Each workload keeps its catalog name and declares its **nodes** in
`deployment.json`; each machine starts one node with `--node`.

- `scenario-simulation`: `--node autoware` on one host, `--node scenario` on
  the other.
- `carla-simulation`: `--node autoware` on one GPU host, `--node carla` on
  the other.

Omitting `--node` keeps today's single-host graph.

The manifest selects `compose.<node>.yaml`. Each entrypoint explicitly includes
its workload services and `../shared/compose.zenoh.yaml`, and mounts its own
`config/zenoh.json5` allowlist. The CLI adds no services or Zenoh-specific paths.
The allowlist is an explicit node `requiredFiles` entry: missing or symlinked
files fail validation before starting containers, without Zenoh-specific CLI logic.
It selects the declared files, image references and env files, and supplies the
node's `rosDomainId` as `OPENADKIT_ROS_DOMAIN_ID`.

Each node is isolated: its own Compose project (`openadkit-<deployment>-<node>`),
its own container names, and its own ROS domain (`rosDomainId` in the
manifest). The nodes only see each other through the Zenoh bridge, so both
nodes can also run on **one machine** for testing, as long as each listens on
its own port (see below).

DDS stays local (`CYCLONEDDS_NETWORK_INTERFACE=lo`, applied by both the
workload containers and the bridge). Only ROS traffic selected by the
workload allowlist crosses Zenoh: simulation time, vehicle status and
commands, transforms, ADAPI calls, and the enabled sensors. Map blobs, camera
images, and the visualization/teleop traffic are not routed.

!!! warning "Evidence scope"
    Split-host nodes ship in the release. Scenario Simulation's required
    split cell tests two isolated nodes on one hosted runner; CARLA is explicitly
    exempt from hosted runtime CI. Existing observations include:

    - Both node views are rendered and validated in CI (`docker compose config`).
    - On one host, the two scenario-simulation nodes pass the sample scenario
      over Zenoh, and the scenario node's ROS domain sees no Autoware nodes,
      only the bridged topics.
    - On a lab pair, sample scenarios pass and a CARLA goal reaches
      `ArrivedGoal` over the bridge.

    Bridge restart resilience and recorded CARLA throughput and latency
    evidence are still open. One-runner evidence is not a general two-host,
    WAN or vehicle compatibility claim; see the [release policy](../releases/evidence.md).

## Prerequisites

On both hosts:

- Host setup via [Getting Started](../getting-started/index.md).
- The same Open AD Kit release and ROS distro on both machines.
- Layer-2/3 connectivity between the hosts and `7447/tcp` open **only**
  between them. Topic allowlists are not authentication; do not expose the
  port to a WAN.

Fetch data on the hosts that mount it:

```bash
openadkit fetch scenario-simulation   # both hosts (the runner bind-mounts MAP_PATH)
openadkit fetch carla-simulation      # Autoware host only (the map is autoware-scoped)
```

## Configure the bridge endpoints

Create or edit `~/.config/openadkit/<workload>.env` on each host. Use the
host's LAN IP, not `0.0.0.0`:

| Host | Variables |
| --- | --- |
| Autoware (`--node autoware`) | `ZENOH_LISTEN=tcp/<autoware-host-ip>:7447` |
| Simulator (`--node scenario` or `--node carla`) | `ZENOH_LISTEN=tcp/<sim-host-ip>:7447` and `ZENOH_PEER=tcp/<autoware-host-ip>:7447` |

The Autoware node is listen-only and starts first. `validate` and `run` on the
connecting node fail fast when `ZENOH_PEER` is unset; `stop`, `status`, and
`logs` never need either variable.

To run both nodes on one machine, pass the endpoints per command instead, with
a separate port for each node:

```bash
ZENOH_LISTEN=tcp/127.0.0.1:7447 openadkit run scenario-simulation --node autoware
ZENOH_LISTEN=tcp/127.0.0.1:7448 ZENOH_PEER=tcp/127.0.0.1:7447 \
  openadkit run scenario-simulation --node scenario
```

## Scenario simulation

Start Autoware first:

```bash
# Autoware host
openadkit run scenario-simulation --node autoware
```

Then the scenario host:

```bash
openadkit run scenario-simulation --node scenario
```

The runner waits up to `SCENARIO_READY_TIMEOUT` for Autoware readiness over
Zenoh before launching the scenario. Results are written on the **scenario**
host under `~/.local/state/openadkit/scenario-simulation/output`. The visualizer stays on the
Autoware host; noVNC is loopback-only (`WEBSOCKIFY_BIND`), so remote desks use
an SSH tunnel.

Stop each host; the CLI finds the live node from its Compose project:

```bash
openadkit stop scenario-simulation
```

## CARLA

Both hosts need an NVIDIA GPU. Start Autoware first:

```bash
# Autoware host
openadkit run carla-simulation --node autoware
```

Then the CARLA host:

```bash
openadkit run carla-simulation --node carla
```

CARLA RPC (`127.0.0.1:2000`) and map loading stay local to the CARLA host.
The interface publishes simulation time, the enabled lidar/IMU/GNSS sensors,
vehicle status, and transforms; Autoware publishes control commands. Cameras
are disabled in `sensor_mapping.yaml`; enabling them requires an allowlist and
throughput update.

## Allowlist

Each workload ships its Zenoh allowlist in
`deployments/<workload>/config/zenoh.json5`, mounted into the bridge of
every node. Entries are full-name regular expressions, not globs. Both
hosts use the same file: either side can own an endpoint. Review the list
before routing anything new, and keep the host boundary on the lab LAN:
the allowlist is not authentication.

The scenario allowlist carries the simple sensor simulator's
`/sensing/imu/imu_data` because autonomous emergency braking and
autonomous-mode availability on the Autoware host depend on it; without
it the vehicle stays in `PLANNING` and the scenario times out.

## Latency and timing

Cross-host simulation is timing sensitive. With a large round-trip time the
TF stream jitters and control nodes log transform or collision-detector
warnings even when scenarios still pass. Keep both hosts on the same lab
LAN; WAN and VPN links are best-effort and are not the supported setup.

## Lifecycle notes

- `stop`, `status`, and `logs` find the live node from its Compose project, so
  you normally omit `--node`. When several nodes of one deployment run on the
  same machine, pass `--node` to choose one.
- Re-running a live node updates it in place. Starting the single-host graph
  while a node is live, or a node while the single-host graph is live, is
  refused: stop it first.
- Do not restart a single bridge or interface container while the split is
  live: route churn can leave a bridged topic half-connected until both hosts
  restart. Stop and start the node instead (see Troubleshooting).

## Troubleshooting

If RViz shows no **Auto** button and
`/api/operation_mode/change_to_autonomous` answers "The target mode is not
available", a bridged vehicle-status topic has stopped flowing:

- Diagnosis on the Autoware host: a state monitor logs a bridge topic timeout
  (for example `/vehicle/status/steering_status topic is timeout`), and
  `/system/command_mode/availability` reports autonomous mode unavailable.
- Cause: restarting a single bridge or interface container in a live split
  can leave Zenoh routes half-created (a route is removed and not recreated),
  so the topic no longer crosses.
- Remedy: stop the workload on both hosts and start the nodes again
  (`openadkit stop <name>`, then `openadkit run <name> --node ...`). A
  clean restart restores the routes.
