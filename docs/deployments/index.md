# Deployments

A **deployment** is a running instance of Open AD Kit, a specific combination of Autoware components configured to achieve a particular task, such as a simulation or a full autonomous driving stack.

## Samples

Sample deployment configurations to help you get started. Recommended for **learning and development**.

- [CARLA Simulation](samples/carla-simulation/index.md) - Run Autoware planning/control with CARLA as the external simulator.
- [Planning Simulation](samples/planning-simulation/index.md) - Run the Autoware planning simulation with a sample map.
- [Scenario Simulation](samples/scenario-simulation/index.md) - Run the Autoware scenario simulation with the TIER IV Scenario Simulator.
- [Logging Simulation](samples/logging-simulation/index.md) - Run the Autoware logging simulation with a sample rosbag.

## Demos

Demo deployment configurations that are specific to certain **use case scenarios**.

- [Zenoh-bridge](demos/zenoh-bridge/index.md) - Demonstrates a "Cloud-Edge" deployment model by seamlessly bridging two isolated ROS 2 environments, decoupling compute-intensive components from lightweight visualization tools.
