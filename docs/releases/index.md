# Releases

--8<-- "includes/first-release-note.md"

[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/openadkit/releases) is
the canonical source for published versions, release notes and provenance
metadata. Each stable release publishes:

- a versionless `openadkit` installer
- the versioned `openadkit-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz` bundle: the CLI and the catalog of
  deployments
- `release-metadata.json`: the pinned Autoware release, ROS distros, image
  digests, the BOM, the bundle's checksum, the passing evidence summary and
  the CI exemptions
- `autoware-lock.repos` and `upstream-images.json`: the Autoware sources and
  the upstream images the build started from
- build provenance for the installer, bundle and metadata

The release notes open with the highlights and the install command, list the
merged pull requests by type, and summarize the evidence. An installed release
moves to the latest stable version with `openadkit upgrade`.

- [Container Images](container-images.md) — image tags, what to pin and the
  image reference
- [Compatibility](compatibility.md) — what a version number promises
- [Evidence Policy](evidence.md) — what a build must pass to be released
- [Verify a Release](verification.md) — check the files before you run them

## Versions

Open AD Kit versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) on their
own, starting at `v2.0.0`: a backward-incompatible change to the CLI, the
manifests or a deployment raises the major version, and a move to a new
Autoware release raises at least the minor version. The release notes list what
breaks, and [Compatibility](compatibility.md) lists what a major
version keeps working.

- **One Autoware release per release.** Releases come from `main`, which pins
  one Autoware release in `.github/autoware.ref`. The
  [GitHub Release](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/openadkit/releases)
  title pairs the two, `Open AD Kit v2.0.1 · Autoware 2.0.0`, and so do
  `openadkit install` and `openadkit version`.
- **Pinned inputs.** A release also pins the ROS distros and every image
  digest, and its images carry the Autoware version they are built from in
  `org.autoware.openadkit.autoware-version`.
- **Backports.** A fix that is upstream but not yet in an Autoware release can
  be [backported](../development/release-process.md#backporting-an-autoware-fix);
  the release notes list it, and the Autoware version stays the tag's.
- **Older versions.** A `release/X.Y` branch is created from a release tag only
  to fix an older version.

## Support

The latest stable release is supported: fixes, including CVE remediation, ship
in a new release, and older releases are not patched.
[Supported Platforms](../platforms/index.md) gives each platform's tier.
Community help is in
[SUPPORT.md](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/openadkit/blob/main/.github/SUPPORT.md);
report security vulnerabilities through the
[private reporting policy](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/openadkit/blob/main/.github/SECURITY.md).
Open AD Kit makes no safety-certification, functional-safety or
production-readiness claim.
