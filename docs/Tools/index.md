# Open AD Kit Tools

Open AD Kit provides a set of tools to help you build, deploy, and manage your autonomous driving system. It's a collection of tools for the Autoware ecosystem.

## Tools

### Simulator

The simulator is a tool that enables users to test their autonomous driving system in a virtual environment. It supports two types of simulators:

- **Ad hoc simulation** : Flexible method for running basic simulations on your local machine, and is the recommended method for anyone new to Autoware.

- **Scenario simulation** : Uses a scenario runner to run more complex simulations based on predefined scenarios. It is often run automatically for continuous integration purposes, but can also be run on a local machine.

### Visualizer

The visualizer is a tool that enables users to visualize the autonomous driving system in a virtual environment using RViz tool. It supports two types of visualizers:

- **Remote Visualization** : Visualizes the RViz output from a remote environment through a browser. It's useful for debugging and monitoring the autonomous driving system in a remote headless environment.

- **Local Visualization** : Visualizes the the RViz screen output on a local display.
