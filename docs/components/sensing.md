# Sensing

## Overview

The sensing component collects, preprocesses, and publishes data from the vehicle's sensors. It runs inside the `sensing-perception` image and provides the raw and preprocessed sensor inputs that feed perception, localization, and other downstream components.

## What This Image Contains

- **LiDAR preprocessing** — Point cloud acquisition, distortion correction, ring filtering, and outlier removal
- **Camera preprocessing** — Image capture, distortion correction, and format conversion
- **Radar preprocessing** — Radar target detection and noise filtering
- **Ultrasonic sensing** — Short-range obstacle detection preprocessing
- **GNSS-INS preprocessing** — Global positioning and inertial navigation data fusion
- **Point cloud container** — Shared in-memory point cloud processing pipeline for efficient preprocessing
- **Launch files available:** `tier4_sensing_component.launch.xml`
- **Typical resource usage:** CPU-intensive without GPU; GPU strongly recommended for point cloud preprocessing. 4–8 GB RAM typical.

## CUDA Variant

The `sensing-perception-cuda` image is an amd64-only, GPU-accelerated variant that offloads point cloud preprocessing and sensor data operations to NVIDIA GPUs. It requires the NVIDIA Container Toolkit and is strongly recommended for [Logging Simulation](../deployment/samples/logging-simulation/index.md) deployments.

## Used In
