# Components

Open AD Kit is a component based project, which means that it is designed to be deployed on a variety of platforms with microservices architecture. Each Autoware component is designed to be independent and can be configured to work together to achieve a particular task, such as a planning simulation or a full autonomous driving stack for a specific vehicle.
