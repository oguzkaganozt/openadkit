# Supported Platforms

As the Autoware Open AD Kit is the first [SOAFEE](https://www.soafee.io/) blueprint for the software defined vehicle ecosystem, it supports a variety of platforms as core SOAFEE platforms.

Here is an explanatory blog post on the [benefits of open standards in automotive development](https://www.soafee.io/blog/2025/the-benefits-of-open-standards-in-automotive-development/).

## SOAFEE Middleware Platforms

### [AutoSD](https://docs.centos.org/automotive-sig-documentation/features-and-concepts/)

AutoSD is the upstream binary distribution that serves as the public, in-development preview of Red Hat In-Vehicle Operating System (OS). AutoSD is downstream of CentOS Stream, so it retains most of the CentOS Stream code with a few divergences, such as an optimized automotive-specific kernel rather than CentOS Stream's kernel package. Red Hat In-Vehicle OS is based on both AutoSD and RHEL, both of which are downstreams of CentOS Stream. 

Instructions on how to build and deploy Open AD Kit on AutoSD can be found in the [AutoSD folder](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/openadkit/tree/main/platforms/autosd).

### [EWAOL](https://ewaol.docs.arm.com/en/kirkstone-dev/)

The Edge Workload Abstraction and Orchestration Layer (EWAOL) is a standards-based, container-centric framework for deploying and orchestrating applications on edge platforms, delivered via the `meta-ewaol` Yocto layer to build distribution images. It organizes the stack into user-defined containerized application workloads (deployed by end users), an EWAOL Linux filesystem that provides core services such as Docker, K3s, and Xen along with validation and development tooling, and platform-specific system software (firmware, bootloader, OS, and optional Xen) integrated from `meta-arm`, `meta-arm-bsp`, and `meta-virtualization`. EWAOL is the reference implementation for SOAFEE, extending cloud-native methods to automotive with an emphasis on real-time and functional safety.

Instructions on how to run Open AD Kit on EWAOL can be found in the [EWAOL folder](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/openadkit/tree/main/platforms/ewaol) (TBD).
